📊 Replication of McDonald's Market Segmentation Case Study in Python
🚀 Project Overview
This project replicates a market segmentation analysis using Python, inspired by McDonald's real-world strategies. The analysis employs data-driven segmentation techniques to identify customer groups based on demographics, behavior, and preferences.

🎯 Objectives
Apply machine learning techniques to analyze McDonald's market segments.

Implement clustering (K-Means) for customer segmentation.

Generate actionable insights for menu optimization, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns.

📌 Dataset
The dataset includes customer purchase patterns, demographics, and behavioral attributes. If not publicly available, a synthetic dataset is generated.

🔧 Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy (Data Preprocessing)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Clustering, PCA, Silhouette Score)

Jupyter Notebook (Implementation)

📊 Methodology
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Selecting key features for segmentation.

Clustering (K-Means): Finding the optimal number of customer segments.

Segmentation Analysis: Profiling customer segments and deriving insights.

Business Recommendations: Optimizing McDonald’s strategies based on findings.

📌 Results & Insights
Identified four key customer segments (e.g., Value Seekers, Health-Conscious, Convenience-Driven, Experience Seekers).

Provided menu, pricing, and marketing strategy recommendations to maximize customer satisfaction and revenue.
